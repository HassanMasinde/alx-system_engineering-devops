Application layer
Main article: Application firewall
Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard released an application firewall known as Firewall Toolkit (FWTK) in October 1993.[23] This became the basis for Gauntlet firewall at Trusted Information Systems.[24][25]

The key benefit of application layer filtering is that it can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Domain Name System (DNS), or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows it to identify unwanted applications or services using a non standard port, or detect if an allowed protocol is being abused.[26] It can also provide unified security management including enforced encrypted DNS and virtual private networking.[27][28][29]

As of 2012, the next-generation firewall provides a wider range of inspection at the application layer, extending deep packet inspection functionality to include, but is not limited to:

Web filtering
Intrusion prevention systems
User identity management
Web application firewall
